### Brief description

In `index.html` you can insert the layout of your email.

The `components` directory contains html files that can describe individual blocks, such as an email header, a text block, a product block, and so on.

To insert a block in `index.html` you must call the block using the lodash syntax:
```lodash
<%=_.template(require(‘./link/to/your/component.html’).default)(data)%>
```

The `template` method takes a string with an html template as a parameter. In our case, we get the template using the `require` method.

`data` – any JavaScript object with a set of data that we can use inside the html template which we called.

You can read more about the template method and the lodash template engine [here](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15).
